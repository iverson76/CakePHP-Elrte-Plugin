Eltre Helper for CakePHP 2.0

This file does not include the files for Elrte available at : https://github.com/Studio-42/elRTE

Installation
============

1. From the elrte package move elrte-inner.css and elrte.min.css to /webroot/css/

2. From the elrte package move elrte.min.js to /webroot/js

3. Personal preference was to maintain the CakePHP folder structure, to move the images to /webroot/img and rename
    all the paths within the css.

Usage
=====

Controller
----------
<?php

class MyController extends AppController
{
    public $helpers = array('Eltre.Editor');
}
?>

View
----
<?php

    echo $this->Form->input('Model.field'),
        $this->Editor->load('Model.field');

TODO
====

1. Improve the javascript integration, e.g. include the FormHelper directly.
2. Include compatability with the the elFinder plugin.
3. Remove the hard-coded jQuery dependency.
